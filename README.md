# Contact Manager Practice Project

**Completed in preparation for Launch School's JS239 assessment project.**

- I built the front end which supports all CRUD operations for working with a collection of Contacts stored in JSON on a backend created by Launch School.
-  Regarding tags: Click a tag on the home page to filter by tag. Click a tag on the edit/add page to remove it from that contact.

The big goal with this one was to create a well organized, easy to follow code base. Managing complexity as things scale is an interesting challenge, but feels really rewarding when I manage to keep things in check throughout a project.
